## Overview

This repository currently contains the project requirements documented as comprehensive user stories. These user stories cover:

- **Guest functionalities:** Browsing and searching products.
- **Customer functionalities:** Account registration, secure login, shopping cart management, checkout, and order tracking.
- **Seller functionalities:** Product listing management and inventory control.
- **Mobile integration:** Responsive design, native features such as push notifications, biometric authentication, QR code scanning, and offline caching.
- **Administrator functionalities:** User and seller management, product moderation, order oversight, and real-time analytics.

At this stage, the requirements file is the primary content. As we progress with development, additional directories (for backend, frontend, tests, scripts, etc.) will be added.
