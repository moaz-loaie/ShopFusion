# ShopFusion

ShopFusion is a cutting-edge e-commerce platform inspired by industry leaders like Amazon. Our goal is to deliver a robust, scalable, and user-friendly online shopping experience that caters to guests, registered customers, sellers, and administrators—with seamless mobile integration.

## Overview

This repository houses our comprehensive project documentation, including detailed requirements and design assets. Our design documentation is organized into multiple files:

- **Design Assets Overview:** Please see [Design Assets Overview](docs/design/design-assest.md) for a complete review of our diagrams, wireframes, and other visual assets.
- **Specific Design Files:**
  - **ERD and System Diagrams:** Editable source files (draw.io) along with exported SVG versions.
  - **Wireframes:** Exported as PNG files.
  - **Figma Designs:** Interactive prototypes and additional design iterations are available via the Figma Design Dashboard.

As development evolves, additional directories for our backend, dynamic frontend, tests, and deployment scripts will be added.
